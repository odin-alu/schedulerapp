# Scheduler | Node.js 

Coping with many coursework deliverables is a stressful part of every studentâ€™s life. Design and implement a web-based coursework scheduling application to help students cope with multiple coursework assignments.  At its core, the coursework scheduling application contains a list of coursework projects that have to be submitted. The application allows the user to define his or her own milestones for each of the coursework projects. These are only visible to this user, i.e. require a login. In order to be useful, the coursework projects and their milestones exist for longer than one session.

The properties of a coursework project can be designed by you but should at least consist of:  
- A title of the coursework project,  
- The module for which it is to be submitted,  
- A breakdown of milestones for each coursework project,  
- An intended due date and,  
- The actual completion date.  

The coursework scheduling application should provide the following core functionality for coursework projects:  
- Coursework projects can be added.  
- Coursework projects can be removed.  
- Coursework projects can be modified.  
- A listing of all incomplete courseworks and their milestones can be viewed.  
- Users should be able to share a project with other users by sending a link. At a base level you can assume that anyone who has the link has permission to see that project.  

The application should be developed using Node.js and Node Express.
